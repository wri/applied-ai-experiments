MODIS Global Fires is a product of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), part of NASA's Earth Science Data.
 EOSDIS integrates remote sensing and GIS technologies to deliver global
 MODIS hotspot/fire locations to natural resource managers and other 
stakeholders around the World.Consumption Best Practices: 

As a service that is subject to very high usage, ensure peak performance
 and accessibility of your maps and apps by avoiding the use of 
non-cacheable relative Date/Time field filters. To accommodate filtering
 events by Date/Time, we suggest using the included ""Age"" fields that 
maintain the number of days or hours since a record was created or last 
modified, compared to the last service update. These queries fully 
support the ability to cache a response, allowing common query results 
to be efficiently provided to users in a high demand service 
environment.When ingesting this service in your applications, avoid using POST
 requests whenever possible. These requests can compromise performance 
and scalability during periods of high usage because they too are not 
cacheable.Source: NASA FIRMS - Active Fire Data - for WorldScale/Resolution: 1kmUpdate Frequency: 1/2 Hour (every 30 minutes) using the Aggregated Live Feed MethodologyArea Covered: WorldWhat can I do with this layer?The
 MODIS thermal activity layer can be used to visualize and assess 
wildfires worldwide. However, it should be noted that this dataset 
contains many “false positives” (e.g., oil/natural gas wells or 
volcanoes) since the satellite will detect any large thermal signal.Additional InformationMODIS stands for MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The MODIS instrument is on board NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM)
 satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south 
across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over 
the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 
days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at
 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.It takes approximately 2 – 4 hours after satellite overpass for MODIS Rapid Response to process the data, and for the Fire Information for Resource Management System
 (FIRMS) to update the website. Occasionally, hardware errors can result in processing delays beyond the 2-4 hour range. Additional 
information on the MODIS system status can be found at MODIS Rapid Response.Attribute InformationLatitude and Longitude:
 The center point location of the 1km (approx.) pixel flagged as 
containing one or more fires/hotspots (fire size is not 1km, but 
variable). Stored by Point Geometry. See What does a hotspot/fire detection mean on the ground?Brightness: The brightness temperature measured (in Kelvin) using the MODIS channels 21/22 and channel 31.Scan and Track:
 The actual spatial resolution of the scanned pixel. Although the 
algorithm works at 1km resolution, the MODIS pixels get bigger toward 
the edge of the scan. See What does scan and track mean?Date and Time:
 Acquisition date of the hotspot/active fire pixel and time of satellite
 overpass in UTC (client presentation in local time). Stored by 
Acquisition Date.Acquisition Date: Derived Date/Time field combining Date and Time attributes.Satellite: Whether the detection was picked up by the Terra or Aqua satellite.Confidence: The detection confidence is a quality flag of the individual hotspot/active fire pixel.Version: Version refers to the processing collection and source of data. The number before the decimal refers to the collection (e.g. MODIS Collection 6). The number after the decimal indicates the source of Level 1B data; data processed in near-real time by MODIS Rapid Response
 will have the source code “CollectionNumber.0”. Data sourced from 
MODAPS (with a 2-month lag) and processed by FIRMS using the standard 
MOD14/MYD14 Thermal Anomalies algorithm
 will have a source code “CollectionNumber.x”. For example, data with 
the version listed as 5.0 is collection 5, processed by MRR, data with 
the version listed as 5.1 is collection 5 data processed by FIRMS using 
Level 1B data from MODAPS.Bright.T31: Channel 31 brightness temperature (in Kelvins) of the hotspot/active fire pixel.FRP:
 Fire Radiative Power. Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power
 in MW (MegaWatts). FRP provides information on the measured radiant 
heat output of detected fires. The amount of radiant heat energy 
liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is thought to be 
related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et. al. 
(2005)).DayNight: The standard processing algorithm uses the solar zenith angle (SZA) to 
threshold the day/night value; if the SZA exceeds 85 degrees it is 
assigned a night value. SZA values less than 85 degrees are assigned a 
day time value. For the NRT algorithm the day/night flag is assigned by 
ascending (day) vs descending (night) observation. It is expected that 
the NRT assignment of the day/night flag will be amended to be 
consistent with the standard processing.Hours Old: 
Derived field that provides age of record in hours between Acquisition 
date/time and latest update date/time. 0 = less than 1 hour ago, 1 = less than 2 hours ago, 2 = less than 3 hours ago, 
and so on.RevisionsJune 22, 2022:

Additionally, special public advisories may be issued at any time due to significant changes in warnings or in a cyclone. For the NHC data source you can subscribe to RSS Feeds.North Pacific and North Indian Ocean tropical cyclone warnings are updated every 6 hours, and South Indian and South Pacific Ocean tropical cyclone warnings are routinely updated every 12 hours. Times are set to Zulu/UTC.Scale/ResolutionThe horizontal accuracy of these datasets is not stated but it is important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center.Area CoveredWorldGlossaryForecast location: Represents the official NHC forecast locations for the center of a tropical cyclone. Forecast center positions are given for projections valid 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after the forecast's nominal initial time. Click here for more information.

Forecast points from the JTWC are valid 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after the forecast’s initial time.Forecast track: This product aids in the visualization of an NHC official track forecast, the forecast points are connected by a red line. The track lines are not a forecast product, as such, the lines should not be interpreted as representing a specific forecast for the location of a tropical cyclone in between official forecast points. It is also important to remember that tropical cyclone track forecasts are subject to error, and that the effects of a tropical cyclone can span many hundreds of miles from the center. Click here for more information.The Cone of Uncertainty: Cyclone paths are hard to predict with absolute certainty, especially days in advance.

The cone represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). The size of each circle is scaled so that two-thirds of the historical official forecast errors over a 5-year sample fall within the circle. Based on forecasts over the previous 5 years, the entire track of a tropical cyclone can be expected to remain within the cone roughly 60-70% of the time. It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center. Click here for more information. Now includes 'Danger Area' Polygons from JTWC, detailing US Navy Ship Avoidance Area when Wind speeds exceed 34 Knots!Coastal Watch/Warning: Coastal areas are placed under watches and warnings depending on the proximity and intensity of the approaching storm.Tropical Storm Watch is issued when a tropical cyclone containing winds of 34 to 63 knots (39 to 73 mph) or higher poses a possible threat, generally within 48 hours. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding. The watch does not mean that tropical storm conditions will occur. It only means that these conditions are possible.Tropical Storm Warning is issued when sustained winds of 34 to 63 knots (39 to 73 mph) or higher associated with a tropical cyclone are expected in 36 hours or less. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding.Hurricane Watch is issued when a tropical cyclone containing winds of 64 knots (74 mph) or higher poses a possible threat, generally within 48 hours. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding. The watch does not mean that hurricane conditions will occur. It only means that these conditions are possible.Hurricane Warning is issued when sustained winds of 64 knots (74 mph) or higher associated with a tropical cyclone are expected in 36 hours or less.

Detection attributes include time, location, and intensity. It can be used to track the location of fires from the recent past, a few hours up to seven days behind real time. This layer also shows the location of wildfire over the past 7 days as a time-enabled service so that the progress of fires over that timeframe can be reproduced as an animation.The VIIRS thermal activity layer can be used to visualize and assess wildfires worldwide. However, it should be noted that this dataset contains many “false positives” (e.g., oil/natural gas wells or volcanoes) since the satellite will detect any large thermal signal.Fire points in this service are generally available within 3 1/4 hours after detection by a VIIRS device. LANCE estimates availability at around 3 hours after detection, and esri livefeeds check for updates every 20 minutes from LANCE.Even though these data display as point features, each point in fact represents a pixel that is >= 375 m high and wide. A point feature means somewhere in this pixel at least one ""hot"" spot was detected which may be a fire.VIIRS is a scanning radiometer device aboard the Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, and NOAA-21 satellites that collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans in several visible and infrared bands. The VIIRS Thermal Hotspots and Fire Activity layer is a livefeed from a subset of the overall VIIRS imagery, in particular from NASA's VNP14IMG_NRT active fire detection product. The source downloads are monitored automatically and retrieved from LANCE, NASA's near real time data and imagery site, every 20 minutes when updates detected.The 375-m data complements the 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Hotspots and Fire Activity layer; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters.Attribute informationLatitude and Longitude: The center point location of the 375 m (approximately) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires/hotspots.Satellite: Whether the detection was picked up by the Suomi NPP satellite (N) or NOAA-20 satellite (1) or NOAA-21 satellite (2). For best results, use the virtual field WhichSatellite, redefined by an arcade expression, that gives the complete satellite name.Confidence: The detection confidence is a quality flag of the individual hotspot/active fire pixel. This value is based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process. It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence values are set to low, nominal and high. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels.Please note: Low confidence nighttime pixels occur only over the geographic area extending from 11 deg E to 110 deg W and 7 deg N to 55 deg S. This area describes the region of influence of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly which can cause spurious brightness temperatures in the mid-infrared channel I4 leading to potential false positive alarms. These have been removed from the NRT data distributed by FIRMS.FRP: Fire Radiative Power. Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (MegaWatts). FRP provides information on the measured radiant heat output of detected fires. The amount of radiant heat energy liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is thought to be related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et. al.

NASA's goal is to get vital fire information to its customers within three hours of observation time. However, the data is screened by a confidence algorithm which seeks to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire points. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Medium confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels. RevisionsSeptember 10, 2025: Switched to alternate source site ‘firms2’ to get around data delivery delays on primary ‘firms’ site.March 7, 2024: Updated to include source data from NOAA-21 Satellite. September 15, 2022: Updated to include 'Hours_Old' field.

ESA has produced land cover maps for the years 1992-2020. These are available at the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative website.Time Extent: 1992-2020Cell Size: 300 meter Source Type: ThematicPixel Type: 8 Bit UnsignedData Projection: GCS WGS84Mosaic Projection: Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere Extent: GlobalSource: ESA Climate Change InitiativeUpdate Cycle: Annual until 2020, no updates thereafterWhat can you do with this layer? This layer may be added to ArcGIS Online maps and applications and shown in a time series to watch a ""time lapse"" view of land cover change since 1992 for any part of the world. The same behavior exists when the layer is added to ArcGIS Pro. In addition to displaying all layers in a series, this layer may be queried so that only one year is displayed in a map.  This layer can be used in analysis. For example, the layer may be added to ArcGIS Pro with a query set to display just one year. Then, an area count of land cover types may be produced for a feature dataset using the zonal statistics tool. Statistics may be compared with the statistics from other years to show a trend. To sum up area by land cover using this service, or any other analysis, be sure to use an equal area projection, such as Albers or Equal Earth. Different Classifications Available to Map Five processing templates are included in this layer. The processing templates may be used to display a smaller set of land cover classes.Cartographic Renderer (Default Template)Displays all ESA CCI land cover classes.*Forested lands TemplateThe forested lands template shows only forested lands (classes 50-90).Urban Lands TemplateThe urban lands template shows only urban areas (class 190).Converted Lands TemplateThe converted lands template shows only urban lands and lands converted to agriculture (classes 10-40 and 190).Simplified RendererDisplays the map in ten simple classes which match the ten simplified classes used in 2050 Land Cover projections from Clark University.Any of these variables can be displayed or analyzed by selecting their processing template. In ArcGIS Online, select the Image Display Options on the layer. Then pull down the list of variables from the Renderer options. Click Apply and Close. In ArcGIS Pro, go into the Layer Properties. Select Processing Templates from the left hand menu. From the Processing Template pull down menu, select the variable to display. Using Time By default, the map will display as a time series animation, one year per frame. A time slider will appear when you add this layer to your map. To see the most current data, move the time slider until you see the most current year. In addition to displaying the past quarter century of land cover maps as an animation, this time series can also display just one year of data by use of a definition query. For a step by step example using ArcGIS Pro on how to display just one year of this layer, as well as to compare one year to another, see the blog called Calculating Impervious Surface Change. Hierarchical ClassificationLand cover types are defined using the land cover classification (LCCS) developed by the United Nations, FAO. It is designed to be as compatible as possible with other products, namely GLCC2000, GlobCover 2005 and 2009. This is a heirarchical classification system. For example, class 60 means ""closed to open"" canopy broadleaved deciduous tree cover. But in some places a more specific type of broadleaved deciduous tree cover may be available. In that case, a more specific code 61 or 62 may be used which specifies ""open"" (61) or ""closed"" (62) cover. Land Cover Processing To provide consistency over time, these maps are produced from baseline land cover maps, and are revised for changes each year depending on the best available satellite data from each period in time. These revisions were made from AVHRR 1km time series from 1992 to 1999, SPOT-VGT time series between 1999 and 2013, and PROBA-V data for years 2013, 2014 and 2015. When MERIS FR or PROBA-V time series are available, changes detected at 1 km are re-mapped at 300 m. The last step consists in back- and up-dating the 10-year baseline LC map to produce the 24 annual LC maps from 1992 to 2015. Source data The datasets behind this layer were extracted from NetCDF files and TIFF files produced by ESA. Years 1992-2015 were acquired from ESA CCI LC version 2.0.7 in TIFF format, and years 2016-2018 were acquired from version 2.1.1 in NetCDF format. These are downloadable from ESA with an account, after agreeing to their terms of use. https://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download.php CitationESA. Land Cover CCI Product User Guide Version 2.
