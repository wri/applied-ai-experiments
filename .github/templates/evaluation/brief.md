# {Experiment Title}

> One-paragraph elevator pitch for this experiment: what we're trying to learn or prove, and why it matters now.

## Before

### What problem or question does this address?

What's the situation that makes this experiment worth running? Connect it to a real need — a team bottleneck, a product gap, a capability we lack, a claim we want to test.

### What does this experiment actually do?

Describe concretely what you'll build, test, or measure. Someone reading this should be able to picture the work.

### What signals are we looking for?

What would make this a clear success? A clear failure? If you have a specific hypothesis, state it here. If you're exploring, describe what a useful vs. useless outcome looks like. This is the section you'll come back to at the end.

### What are the boundaries?

Time box, scope limits, what you're deliberately not doing, dependencies or access you need, known constraints.

## After

_Fill this section out when the experiment concludes or is stopped._

### What happened?

What did you actually do? (Often different from what you planned.)

### What did you learn?

The 2–5 findings someone should take away. Include what surprised you and what confirmed expectations.

### What would you recommend?

Should we adopt this, keep exploring, stop, share it, build on it? Be direct.

### What decisions and tradeoffs came up along the way?

Non-obvious choices you made during the work. Things you tried that didn't work. Forks in the road and which way you went and why. These are often more valuable than the main findings.
